Dear users of Sympa mailing lists and Sympa web site,

Now The Sympa Community has a new domain name.  We would like to
inform you that the addresses of our mailing lists and URLs of web
sites have changed.

If you have any problems with the new mailing list server, please
contact the list owner first.

To contact the list owner, go to the list home page in the web
interface and click "Contact owner".


The mailing lists
-----------------

The mailing lists about Sympa, which have been hosted by RENATER on
their server, have been migrated to the new server on the new
domain.

You do not need to do anything to move to the new mailing list.
However, please note:


### The addresses of the lists have changed

See "Mailing lists" page about the new addresses:

Note that older addresses are no longer usable.  If you have these
addresses in your address book, please update them.


### Web interface is not accessible with previous account

You will no longer be able to log in through the federation.
You will need to create a dedicated password to log in to the web
interface of the new lists.

The web site for the community of Sympa have moved to the new
domain "sympa.community".

    automatically redirected to the new site.
