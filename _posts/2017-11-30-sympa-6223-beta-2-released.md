Sympa with Ansible
------------------

[Sympa-Ansible project](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa-ansible) aims to provide an example of Ansible Playbooks organization focusing on deployment for multiple environments, articulation with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/), [keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar) based encryption. This project is based on [Ansible-tools](https://github.com/pmeulen/ansible-tools) which demonstrates a way to use Ansible to effectively and securely manage multiple environments ranging from development to production using the same playbook.
