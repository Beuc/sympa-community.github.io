### Significant changes

  * Scenarios & list creation templates: Some configuration files for "intranet" use cases were made optional.  See the [notes](https://sympa-community.github.io/manual/upgrade/notes.html#from-version-prior-to-6250-coming-later) for details.

  * Scenarios: Codebase has been rewritten to make execution of scenarios fast (see #782).

  * Family: Codebase has been refactored and regression tests are desirable (see #771).
