Note for upgrading
---------------------

* Even on late versions, several big changes on templates have been made.  Some of them broke backward compatibility in exchange for bug fixes. 

  If you have customized templates with earlier version of Sympa, you should check if web interface will work correctly and if system messages are sent correctly after upgrading, and reapply customization to new templates as necessity.
