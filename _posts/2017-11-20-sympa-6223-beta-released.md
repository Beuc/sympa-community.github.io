Sympa with Ansible
------------------

[**Sympa-Ansible** project](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa-ansible) aims to provide an example of Ansible Playbooks organization focusing on deployment for multiple environments, articulation with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/), [keyczar](https://github.com/google/keyczar) based encryption. This project is based on [Ansible-tools](https://github.com/pmeulen/ansible-tools) which demonstrates a way to use Ansible to effectively and securely manage multiple environments ranging from development to production using the same playbook.

To try out deployment of Sympa with Ansible, see [Quickstart guide](https://github.com/sympa-community/sympa-ansible/blob/master/README.md).
