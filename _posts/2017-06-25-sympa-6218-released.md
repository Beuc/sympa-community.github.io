Note for upgrading
---------------------

* Even after 6.2.16, some big changes on web templates were made.  Especially, templates for shared document repository and list configuration edit form broke backward compatibility in exchange for bug fixes. 

  If you have customized templates with earlier version of Sympa, you should check if web interface will work correctly after upgrading, and reapply customization to new templates as necessity.
