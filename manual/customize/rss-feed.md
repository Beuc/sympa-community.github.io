RSS feed
========

This service is provided by WWSympa (Sympa's web interface). Here is the root of WWSympa's RSS channel: *wwsympa_url*`/rss`,
for example `https://web.example.org/sympa/rss`.

The access control of RSS queries do _not_ proceed on the same way as WWSympa. Indeed, most RSS client do not deliver cookies are are not able to deal with authentication forms or SSO redirection. In addition some popular services are used to share RSS feed and so there is not way to be sure of who is reading a feed. That's why RSS Sympa interface deliver all page as if the user was not authenticated.
You may be disappointed by this restriction if you are using a web browser as RSS reader.
